					<p class="border"> Heyyyyy, hermano. Look what the homosexuals have done to me! You can't just comb that out and reset it? It's a wonderful restaurant! This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it.</p>
					<p>Fun and failure both start out the same way. It walked on my pillow! Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON. Don't leave your Uncle T-bag hanging. She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. Quicken! Premiere!</p>
